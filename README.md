To execute each code one should download the datasets and add them to their repository. One can also find the datasets on Kaggle dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/chocolate-bar-ratings

For each code run the code all at once if there are multiple cells and uncomment some lines to plot the differents curves.
